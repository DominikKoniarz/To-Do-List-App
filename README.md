# To Do List App
A very simple To Do List application created in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
 
# My motivation to build this project
First of all I wanted to develop my skills in DOM manipulation (creating new Elements, adding them classes, attributes and nesting them). <br>
First version of application provided adding tasks by user, marking them as done and deleting from list. <br>
But there was one crucial point. Tasks were not being saved when browser window was closed. <br>
In that way second version was created. Now app stores tasks (as JSON) in browser local storage and read them every time when site is being opened.

# Enjoy!
